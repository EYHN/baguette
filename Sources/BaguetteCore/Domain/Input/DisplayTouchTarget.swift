/// CarPlay addresses its service's fixed target; the screen it shows
/// on has nothing to do with it. `derive` is kept for the caller's
/// shape and deliberately unused there: `IndigoHIDTargetForScreen`
/// over the CarPlay screen id gives `0x40000002`, which nothing
/// registered, and sending there restarted the guest.
///
/// The phone plane addresses the bound panel's own digitizer when a
/// panel is bound (`connectedScreenId`), and the built-in slot when
/// none is. The two coincide on every single-panel device; they part
/// on a foldable, where the slot belongs to the last panel created
/// and the phone plane wants the lit one.
